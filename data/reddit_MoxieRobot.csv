This seems like a very complicated process... I am following the instructions from the email OpenMoxie Setup Guide.  I seem to have run into a problem that I don't understand how to fix. I am using a macbook pro laptop v. 12.7.6 with a hotspot... I down loaded Docker to the desk top. I created a folder on the desk top called OpenMoxie and downloaded the docker-compose.yml and saved it into the OpenMoxie folder. The next process i opened a terminal window and typed ""docker-compose pull"" and hit enter. 

This is what happens:

Last login: Wed Jan 29 22:26:35 on ttys001

me@Mes-MacBook-Air OpenMoxie % docker-compose pull

zsh: command not found: docker-compose

me@Mes-MacBook-Air OpenMoxie % 



Can you please help me with this??? I am running out of time....

I have the Moxie v24.10.803 SN# 2106800034394



Thank you

The Moxie robot was defective out of the box and didn’t work despite 2 calls with their customer service trying to troubleshoot each call for at least an hour. Then we decided to cut our losses and cancel the subscription. I tried my wife tried my assistant tried and they still refused to cancel.  Finally after ALOT of begging we got a customer service rep to agree to cancel verbally and she promised to send an email confirming the cancellation only to find out a month later that they are still charging us. Subsequent attempts to reach out to customer service have been ignored. BUYER BEWARE.

Making a custom schedule for meditation only,"I'm working with a research professor who wants to use her moxie for Human Robotics Interaction (HRI) research. I want to make two custom schedules:

1. Custom meditation journey: Much like the built in meditation journey but moxie will continue it for 5 minutes. I don't want moxie to go through the onboarding steps (the mentor clearance check and the ENROLLCONVO module) and to go straight into the meditation journey. I also want moxie to have the same expressions as the built-in meditation journey. How should I customize the modules and the schedule?

I have tried making a custom schedule copying the no\_onboarding module but the custom module I created isn't as good as the built-in meditation journey. 

2. Another module I am being asked to be added to the robot is a ""fun science facts"" module. When the participants in the study will ask Moxie for a fun fact it will tell it a random fun fact. For the rest of the schedule it will stay silent. Is this custom module possible?",BigAcanthisitta9499,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1j8gxly/making_a_custom_schedule_for_meditation_only/,1741661392.0,2025-03-11 02:49:52,"Well for #1 the difficult part is ""extending"" since the audio meditation is a native module inside Moxie.  Since you can't edit that you can't change it so you'd probably need to make your own meditation module from scratch which is difficult because you'd need to know the right markup to play the custom backing audio effects.   The other parts: going directly into the module and skipping enrollment are doable via the WAKEUP\_LAUNCHER (I think its documented) to bypass the wakeup animations and setting the max\_enroll setting to ""0"" to ensure enrollment doesn't occur.

Audio Med is mostly using a ""monologue"" pattern (play a bunch of lines in order mostly ignoring the user) which is implementable in a code block - you add a eb\_wait\_monologue execute action with each output produce empty responses for any generic inputs and on the eb-wait-complete input you produce the next line.  (see https://github.com/jbeghtol/openmoxie/blob/main/doc/RemoteModuleAPI.md).  BUT it's sadly more complex than that to achieve parity with Moxie native if you want sound effects and to use the eyes closed behavior tree.  To do that you'd need to prefix every line with the markup to restore the eyes closed and as needed the custom markup for sounds.  You'd need to know these markup strings and they haven't been documented (yet at least).  

Not sure I follow the ""stay silent"" part you mention in #2.  You can likely make a fun science fact prompt but it will generally reply to everything.  I'm unsure when it should stop but you can probably make a module that replies to everything with ""."" or something inaudible when you need to using the custom code field.

None of this is made particularly easier by editing the OpenMoxie source directly.  Almost everything can be done using code blocks in SinglePromptChat conversations.",C0
Making a custom schedule for meditation only,"I'm working with a research professor who wants to use her moxie for Human Robotics Interaction (HRI) research. I want to make two custom schedules:

Then this morning I couldn't sleep so I made a little sample to show you what I mean about monologue nodes... I didn't test this on Moxie because other people are sleeping but it might work or at least be close (I tested via sim).

OpenMoxie v0.8 Now Available,"Hi folks

First off I wanted to mention you never really need to upgrade if you don't want to.  You are in control by choosing to docker-compose pull or not so if a particular update doesn't sound useful for you feel free not to update.

That said there's a new update: v0.8.  This release's key feature is ""Application Framework"" which is to say it adds the ability to make richer new content for Moxie.  Even if you don't plan on creating your own content it enables people to export and import content so it should hopefully create some sharing of content modules from the more tech-savvy in the community.

High level view:  
\- Adds a system for local and persistent data to be used in conversation prompts via template expansion or through custom python methods added to your conversation  
\- Enables custom code blocks to run ahead of or after chat completions as well as post processing hooks to enable summarization and post-processing conversations  
\- Allows import/export of conversations global responses and schedules: the three primary content pieces  
\- Includes 4 custom content sets to demonstrate these capabilities including asking for the time setting a real-time timer launching activities using QR codes and natural language and conversations that save and use memories from conversations - and an About Me module to ask about what it has learned.  
\- Updated documentation for Conversations and advanced features like events and execution actions

This does have some data schema updates a few new columns and a new table for persistent data.  It might have some bugs too I've done my best not to introduce them but sometimes they happen despite my best efforts.

I did make a video this one is quite long (43 minutes) and even so I feel like I really went over everything more quickly than I wanted: [https://youtu.be/ou1J5qVbuHA](https://youtu.be/ou1J5qVbuHA)

As always I recommend keeping the github link as a reference: [https://github.com/jbeghtol/openmoxie](https://github.com/jbeghtol/openmoxie) where you can read the [updated docs](https://github.com/jbeghtol/openmoxie/tree/main/doc) or see the [QR codes](https://github.com/jbeghtol/openmoxie/tree/main/site/data/qr) for launching modules from the Moxie GO launcher or download any of the new [content examples](https://github.com/jbeghtol/openmoxie/tree/main/content_modules).

A final word of caution about importing content: This python code is run inside the container so it has limited ability to do things to your system at large but it is \*code\* that will be executed so make sure you only import content from trusted persons and if you can review the code before importing / running it.

As usual the update process is generally just to open a terminal in the same folder you saved the docker-compose.yml file and typing these.  I included a backup of the v07 database because if you for some reason have to go back it will be easier if you have a database backup (the copy is for windows for mac/linux use `cp local/work/db.sqlite3 db_v07.sqlite3` instead):

OpenMoxie v0.8 Now Available,"Hi folks

First off I wanted to mention you never really need to upgrade if you don't want to.  You are in control by choosing to docker-compose pull or not so if a particular update doesn't sound useful for you feel free not to update.

That said there's a new update: v0.8.  This release's key feature is ""Application Framework"" which is to say it adds the ability to make richer new content for Moxie.  Even if you don't plan on creating your own content it enables people to export and import content so it should hopefully create some sharing of content modules from the more tech-savvy in the community.

High level view:  
\- Adds a system for local and persistent data to be used in conversation prompts via template expansion or through custom python methods added to your conversation  
\- Enables custom code blocks to run ahead of or after chat completions as well as post processing hooks to enable summarization and post-processing conversations  
\- Allows import/export of conversations global responses and schedules: the three primary content pieces  
\- Includes 4 custom content sets to demonstrate these capabilities including asking for the time setting a real-time timer launching activities using QR codes and natural language and conversations that save and use memories from conversations - and an About Me module to ask about what it has learned.  
\- Updated documentation for Conversations and advanced features like events and execution actions

This does have some data schema updates a few new columns and a new table for persistent data.  It might have some bugs too I've done my best not to introduce them but sometimes they happen despite my best efforts.

First off I wanted to mention you never really need to upgrade if you don't want to.  You are in control by choosing to docker-compose pull or not so if a particular update doesn't sound useful for you feel free not to update.

That said there's a new update: v0.8.  This release's key feature is ""Application Framework"" which is to say it adds the ability to make richer new content for Moxie.  Even if you don't plan on creating your own content it enables people to export and import content so it should hopefully create some sharing of content modules from the more tech-savvy in the community.

High level view:  
\- Adds a system for local and persistent data to be used in conversation prompts via template expansion or through custom python methods added to your conversation  
\- Enables custom code blocks to run ahead of or after chat completions as well as post processing hooks to enable summarization and post-processing conversations  
\- Allows import/export of conversations global responses and schedules: the three primary content pieces  
\- Includes 4 custom content sets to demonstrate these capabilities including asking for the time setting a real-time timer launching activities using QR codes and natural language and conversations that save and use memories from conversations - and an About Me module to ask about what it has learned.  
\- Updated documentation for Conversations and advanced features like events and execution actions

The person in the video said his would turn on but then glitch out and stop working. Many people in the comments had said the same. He also said that he had tried calling support and that used to work well but now you can’t get in touch with anyone and he even attempted emailing the company a few times to no response. Upon further looking into this it appears that moxie is now “sold out” on both the site and Amazon now I don’t know what that means but I have a strong speculation that they haven’t been doing well especially since they have been putting it on sale for 600-400 quite a bit. That seems really cheep for something that is aparently worth 1600 plus a monthly subscription. 

I think this is incredibly sad because this seems like it was well intentioned and that really is sad for people who were most likely new buyers I saw some people who purchased this even like 2 or 3 months ago. Hopefully they come up with a solution for all the people who bought these so they atleast can still work or something :( here’s a link to the video I saw [moxie not working](https://youtu.be/oM7VlxQmjYQ?si=cRBGeNQuJUny-iqi)


Also idk if you have a child that was benefiting from moxie or were looking to buy one but there looks like a few new options possibly would they be a good option

Did anyone else’s Moxie stop working? ,,OliveBranchez,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1gr9nwj/did_anyone_elses_moxie_stop_working/,1731604141.0,2024-11-14 17:09:01,"Moxie by Embodied is closing due to financial challenges. A critical funding round fell through leaving us unable to sustain operations.  When exactly will Moxie stop working?

We don’t know the exact date when services will cease. It is likely to happen within days. However we are exploring options to keep Moxie operational for as long as possible although we cannot provide any guarantees.

 Will Moxie still work without cloud services?

No Moxie relies on cloud connectivity for its core features and it will not function once services end.",C0-L0

Any plans for a version 2 Moxie?,"Wish list:

- More languages (like Chinese and French) so kids can lean new languages while interacting with Moxie
- Longer battery life 
- Some type of wheels to allow movie to follow the kid

- Much better audio quality
